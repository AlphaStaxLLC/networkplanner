NP Electricity Infrastructure Prototyping Framework
===================================================

`NP <http://october.mech.columbia.edu>`_ is a decision support tool for exploring electrification options in rural communities.  It has been used to compare the long-term costs of installing solar, diesel or grid distribution networks and perform sensitivity analyses on variables such as demand growth for electrification plans in Kenya, Senegal and Ghana.

`Click here to begin using the system <http://october.mech.columbia.edu>`_.  You are encouraged to experiment by changing variables to fit the economic profile of your region.  More experienced users can upload custom datasets of unelectrified communities and the locations of existing high and medium voltage lines.

Given community locations and populations, the system projects electricity demand, compares costs for different electricity technology options and suggests where to extend the grid.  If provided the location of existing grid lines, the system will optimize the grid extension to use the existing grid.  If provided community-specific values for model variables, the system will use the community-specific values during computation.

The value of NP is its ability to compute detailed cost projections and operations research algorithms in a relatively short time and with as little or as much data as is available.
