NP Electricity Infrastructure Prototyping Framework
===================================================

NP is a decision support tool for exploring electrification options in rural communities.  It has been used to perform sensitivity analyses on variables such as change in interest rate, growth in demand or fluctuations in diesel fuel cost for electrification plans in Kenya, Senegal and Ghana.

Given community locations and populations, the system projects electricity demand, compares costs for different electricity technology options and suggests where to extend the grid.  If provided the location of existing grid lines, the system will optimize the grid extension to use the existing grid.  If provided community-specific values for model variables, the system will use the community-specific values during computation.
